# Jack's Cellular Automata Explorer

This is a web-based cellular automata explorer that allows you to visualize and experiment with different cellular automata rule sets, such as Conway's Game of Life.

## Features

*   Configurable grid size
*   Clickable cells to toggle their state (alive or dead)
*   Playback controls (step, play, stop)
*   Adjustable simulation speed
*   Configurable birth and survival rules
*   Random and clear grid initialization
*   Randomness percentage control
*   Responsive layout

## How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  Use the "Birth" and "Survival" input boxes to define the rules for cell birth and survival.
    *   For example, Conway's Game of Life is B3/S23 (Birth on 3 neighbors, Survival on 2 or 3 neighbors).
3.  Use the "Step", "Play", and "Stop" buttons to control the simulation.
4.  Use the "Speed" slider to adjust the simulation speed.
5.  Use the "Random" button to initialize the grid with a random pattern.
6.  Use the "Clear" button to clear the grid.
7.  Use the "Random %" slider to control the amount of randomness when the "Random" button is clicked.
8.  Click on a cell to toggle its state between alive and dead.
